# **1. Information We Do NOT Collect**

YanRadio is designed with privacy in mind.
We **do not** collect, store, or share any of the following:

- No personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- No account or login data
- No device identifiers (IDFA, advertising ID)
- No location data
- No contacts, photos, or files

# **2. Information We May Collect Automatically**

For the app to function properly, the following **non-personal, anonymous technical data** may be processed:

### **2.1. Playback & Diagnostic Data (Local Only)**

The app may temporarily store:

- playback position
- buffer/rewind data (up to 30 minutes)
- crash logs (if provided by the device OS)

These are **stored locally on your device only** and are **not transmitted to us**.

### **2.2. Streaming Data**

When you play a radio station, your device connects directly to the station’s public streaming URL.
These networks may receive standard technical information such as:

- IP address
- device type
- connection logs required for streaming

This is handled directly by the streaming provider, not YanRadio.

---

# **3. How We Use Information**

Since we do not collect personal data, the only information used is:

- **Local playback data** to provide pause/rewind functionality
- **Technical streaming requests** needed to play radio content

No information is used for advertising, profiling, or analytics.

# **4. Third-Party Services**

YanRadio streams content from publicly available radio stations (e.g., ABC, 3CW, 2CR, VAC, CRI, ACR).
These providers may have their own privacy practices.
We encourage you to review their policies if needed.

YanRadio does **not** share any personal data with these stations.

We also do **not** use:

- third-party analytics SDKs
- advertising networks
- tracking libraries

---

# **5. Data Storage and Security**

- YanRadio does not store any personal data on servers.
- All buffering and playback data remain **on your device**.
- If you delete the app, all locally stored temporary data will be removed automatically.

# **6. Children’s Privacy**

YanRadio does not collect personal information from children or adults.
The app is safe for users of all ages.

# **7. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements or legal requirements.
